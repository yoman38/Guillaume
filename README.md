🌟 I'm a passionate engineer with a Master's degree in Energy and Fluids Engineering from France. My educational journey has been marked by a strong focus on project design.

🔍 I'm learning some skills in data analysis, specifically in impact analysis and price prediction using ML models.

🔧 My technical acumen is complemented by my proficiency in a variety of software, including Salesforce, MS Project, and advanced knowledge in R, Python, and VBA, amongst others.

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Javascript (and react native), and I'm always up for a challenging coding project or an intriguing data puzzle.

💼 Professionally, I've managed business operations as a Business Manager in HVAC and worked as an Energy Efficiency Certificates specialist with a technical and competitive focus.

📈 I'm also proud of my contributions to various projects, such as automation on EXCEL and REVIT. Many of my missions as an EEC specialist were Methods related. 

🎯 I'm actively seeking opportunities to work as a freelancer.

📚 In my free time, I enjoy honing my strategic thinking through Jiu-Jitsu and unwinding with hobbies that stimulate my creativity.
