My zeal for engineering stems from envisioning concepts and bringing them to life through robust and efficient designs. I pride myself on the care I put into the practicality, sophistication, and integrity of the projects I undertake.

I'm also captivated by the world of open-source and its ethos of collective intelligence and sharing. My journey has been enriched by the open-source community, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to and fostering this ecosystem of innovation and collaboration.
